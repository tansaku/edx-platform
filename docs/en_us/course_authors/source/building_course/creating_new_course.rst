Create a New Course

  .. note::  Enter new course information carefully. This information becomes
   part of the URL for your course. To change the URL after the course is
   created, you must contact edX through the Help site
   (http://help.edge.edx.org). Additionally, because this information becomes
   part of your course URL, the total number of characters in the following
   three fields must be 65 or fewer.

  * For **Course Name**, enter the title of your course. For example, the name
    may be â€œSets, Maps and Symmetry Groups". Use title capitalization for the
    course title.

  * For **Organization**, enter the name of your university. Do not include
    whitespace or special characters.

  * For **Course Number**, enter both a subject abbreviation and a number. For
    example, for public health course number 207, enter **PH207**. For math
    course 101x, enter **Math101x**. Do not include whitespace or special
    characters in the course number.

    .. note:: If your course will be open to the world, be sure to include the
     "x". If it is exclusively an on-campus offering, do not include the "x".*

  * For **Course Run**, enter the term your course will run. Do not include
    whitespace or special characters.

    The Course Run date you enter does not affect the default **Course Start
    Date**.  See :ref:`Set Important Dates for Your Course` for more
    information.

4. Click **Save.**

You then see the empty Course Outline.

.. _Edit Your Course:

************************
Edit Your Course
************************
When you create a new course, the course opens in Studio automatically and you
can begin editing.

If you come back to Studio later, your courses are listed on the Studio login
page.

To open the course, click the course name. You go to the Course Outline. 

.. _Use the Course Checklist:

************************
Use the Course Checklist
************************

You can use a Course Checklist within Studio to help you work through the tasks
of building a course.

Categories of tasks in the Course Checklist include:

* Getting Started with Studio
* Draft a Rough Course Outline
* Explore edX's Support Tools
* Draft Your Course About Page

From the **Tools** menu, select **Checklists**.

As shown above for the **Add Course Team Members** task, if you hover over a
task, a button is displayed that takes you to the page to complete that task.

You can expand and collapse sections of this page as needed.

You can check tasks as you complete them. Studio saves your changes
automatically. Other course staff can see your changes.

.. _Add Course Team Members:

************************
Add Course Team Members
************************

Course team members are users who help you build your course.

Only a team member with Admin access can add or remove course team members, or
grant Admin access to other team members.

Other course team members can edit the course and perform all tasks except
adding and removing other new team members and granting Admin access.

.. note::  Any course team member can delete content created by other team
 members.

All course team members must be registered with Studio and have an active
account.

To add a course team member:

#. Ensure you have Admin access.
#. Ensure that the new team member has registered with Studio.
#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Course Team**.
#. Click **Add a New Team Member**.
#. Enter the new team member's email address, then click **ADD USER**.
